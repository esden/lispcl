The following examples were originally written by Radu Bogdan Rusu as Java-Client examples (http://java-player.sourceforge.net/examples-2.php). These examples are rewritten in Lisp to demonstrate LISPCL.

To use these examples you have to load lispcl-test.asd in Lisp.

Space Wanderer
==============
The example shows a basic Space Wanderer algorithm for a Pioneer-like mobile robot with 8 sonars

- start player/stage:
    player space-wanderer.cfg
- in Lisp:
    (in-package "LISPCL")
  start the non-threaded version for 60 seconds:
    (space-wanderer)
  start the threaded version:
    (space-wanderer :threaded T)
  stop threaded version:
    (pc-test-stop)
  The non-threaded version accepts the keyword argument timeout in seconds to alter the duration:
    (space-wanderer :timeout 120)

Wall Follower example
=====================
The example shows a very simple implementation of a Wall Follower behavior, by using only the information from the left and front SONAR sensors.

- start player/stage:
    player wall-follower.cfg
- in Lisp:
    (in-package "LISPCL")
  start the wall follower 60 seconds:
    (wall-follower)
  Optional the keyword argument timeout in second can be given:
    (wall-follower :timeout 300)

Blob Finder examples
====================
A basic example on how to use the Blobfinder interface together with Stage, for a Pioneer-like mobile robot. The robot navigates around using the basic SpaceWanderer algorithm

- start player/stage:
    player blob-finder.cfg
- in Lisp:
    (in-package "LISPCL")
  start the non-threaded version for 60 seconds:
    (blob-finder)
  start the threaded version:
    (blob-finder :threaded T)
  stop threaded version:
    (pc-test-stop)
  The non-threaded version accepts the keyword argument timeout in seconds to alter the duration:
    (blob-finder :timeout 120)
